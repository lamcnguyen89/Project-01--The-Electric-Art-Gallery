                Users can virtually travel to galleries across the world they may not be able to visit otherwise.
                This can give opportunity to see work and/or inspire art lovers to travel to different galleries and
                explore different cultures.
                Inspiration
                Due to the recent virus pandemic we are unable to travel or gather in public spaces making galleries
                and museums visits obsolete for the time being. With this application we can continue our pursuit of
                knowledge and love of art! As a painter, group member Karleigh was looking for a quick way to view
                many galleries collections. There are articles written on top museums but nowhere to toggle between
                them in an elegant manner.
