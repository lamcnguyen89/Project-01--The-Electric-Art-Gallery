# The Electric Art Gallery

This application allows users to search for a select group of big art galleries on a map.
Once a gallery is selected the used is brought to a new html page that consists of:
-Left hand column with artists available to view at said gallery
-Right hand grid that artist pieces will be appended to.
-Button to return to map

### Value
Users can virtually travel to galleries across the world they may not be able to visit otherwise. This can give opportunity to see work and/or inspire art lovers to travel to different galleries and explore different cultures.

This application could be easily scaled up and expanded to many different art museums across the world. For now we have focused on art museums, but this could be easily expanded to many other types of museums from science to history

### Inspiration

Due to the recent virus pandemic we are unable to travel or gather in public spaces making galleries and museums visits obsolete for the time being. With this application we can continue our pursuit of knowledge and love of art! As a painter, group member Karleigh was looking for a quick way to view many galleries collections. There are articles written on top museums but nowhere to toggle between them in an elegant manner.
